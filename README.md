# airsim_grid2.0

### Repo Guidelines
---
Use this branch only for direct controller code. Or maybe nothing. TBD

 - All hardware related files go into `hardware-files`
 - All simulator related files go into `sim-files`
 - Rest TBD

---

1. Git clone https://github.com/uzh-rpg/minimum_jerk_trajectories and put in parent directory (or append path in `min_jerk_uzh.py`).
2. Run `python trajectory_follower.py` with Airsim running.
